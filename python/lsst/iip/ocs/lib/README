# C++ Libraries for L1 Development 

### [Rabbitmq-c v.0.5.3](https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c)
L1 system uses Rabbitmq Messaging server to transfer messages between various components.
Rabbitmq-c is the API for our components to use messaging. 

### [SimpleAmqpClient v2.4.0](https://github.com/alanxz/SimpleAmqpClient)
SimpleAmqpClient is the wrapper around Rabbitmq-c.

### [Yaml-cpp v0.8.0](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
To make the communication among components easier, we use yaml messages to send over the line. 
Yaml-cpp converts our message strings into key, value pairs, which then we uses in L1.
