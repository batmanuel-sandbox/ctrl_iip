OCS_Bridge and CommandListener are dependent on 
* Rabbitmq-c <https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c> 
* AmqpClient <https://github.com/alanxz/SimpleAmqpClient> 

After installing the libraries, 
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

Then, 
    make -f makefile // to generate obj file for OCS_Bridge
    make -f makefile.CommandListener // to generate executable CommandListener
